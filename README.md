# Greenit Plugin for Obsidian

A feature-rich plugin for Obsidian that helps you track your daily habits with an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Features

- **Multiple Habit Views**: Track your habits in three different ways:
    - **GitHub-style Year View**: A familiar contribution graph showing your activity over the past year.
    - **Month View**: A traditional monthly calendar for a detailed daily view.
    - **Year Overview**: See all 12 months of the year at a glance, perfect for reviewing long-term progress.
- **Comprehensive Habit Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete habits using a clean UI with a custom dropdown selector.
- **Interactive Tracking**: Click on any day in the calendar views to toggle a habit as completed or not completed for that day.
- **Automatic Data Persistence**: All your habit data is automatically saved and loaded with your vault. No manual configuration files needed.
- **Streak Calculation**: The plugin automatically calculates and displays your current habit streak (visible in the GitHub-style view).
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes and Obsidian themes.
